## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking out time to check out this project.

**To complete this project, I made use of HTML, CSS and Javascript-for the mobile navigation toggle**

## The Project

This project is a landing page for Insure. The design was provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), I developed it making sure it looked as close to the design as possible.

I also ensured the users were able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Working on this project, I was able to:

- Refresh my JavaScript skills (creating variables, using if else statements)
- Improve my skills on building responsive web pages
- Improve my skills working on a real-life workflow
